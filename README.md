# PyBlackJack

## Description
PyBlackJack is a fun way to waste time at the terminal playing blackjack with a computerized dealer. The user and dealer each start out with two cards. The user can choose to hit or stand. Choosing to hit will add a card, while standing will turn it over to the dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. Going over 21 is called a bust and will cause the player to lose. Each numbered card is equal in points to the number written on them. Each "face" card is worth 10 points, and an Ace can be either a 1 or an 11, whichever is more beneficial. Everything is run through the command line. There is no betting in this versionâ€”just a simple game of Blackjack.
